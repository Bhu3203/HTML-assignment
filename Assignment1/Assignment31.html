        Jenny Kakoudakis’ interior design blog, Seasons in Colour, equips
        professional designers with educational content—all within a
        sophisticated, tasteful and user-friendly site. In fact, it earned an
        Amara Interior Blog Award back in 2016.

        The first fold of the site is a full-bleed image of the feature story.
        The secondary feature appears on a black background, which breaks up the
        design of the site while calling attention to an article that Jenny is
        particularly proud of. To monetize the blog, she built a shopping page
        full of affiliate links.

            <b>Keep the design simple</b>. Although the Seasons in Colour blog
            has tons of content on it, the minimalist design prevents readers
            from feeling overwhelmed.

            <b>Be consistent with your blogging.</b> If you want to create a
            successful blog when starting a business, you need to publish new
            content on a regular basis. Seasons in Colour consistently puts out
            new and high-quality content, establishing it as a leading blog in
            its niche.
